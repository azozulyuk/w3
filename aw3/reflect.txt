During the workshop I have learned how to work with bigger data files like credit cards, etc. It was a very logical and useful workshop in the way that I had to check whether the data actually exists and in terms of timing (like whether the time/month/year actually match and make sense). The difficulty that I faced as I was completing the workshop was the data correction when output happened (some numbers were not matching, and I was challenged to fix the issue and find where the mistake was). Also, I have had good practice with the dynamic memory and how to work with it safely. It took me hours to debug some little mismatches with the expected output. Overall, I would suggest maybe more explanations during class time on how to work with multiple files during lecture time because there are lots of small details that took me a long time to figure out while completing
